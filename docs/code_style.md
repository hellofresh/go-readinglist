# Code Style

Unfortunately there is no official Code Style Guide by the Go team, although there is certainly a solid convention on code style that is enforced by `go fmt` and a few other tools.

Two resources that will help you to start writing Go in style include:

1. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)
2. [Go Wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
